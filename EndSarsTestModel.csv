And yes massacre can have survivors"

Oh, my day is made!!!

#EndSARS"
OmoGbajaBiamila,"@gbemifizzy @PoliceNG @EndSars They agreed to let the boys go but what they didn't know is that @GbemiFizzy was aware of their plot. The plan was to let the boys go and then they track them when he's left, to continue the harassment.

OmoGbajaBiamila,"@gbemifizzy @PoliceNG @EndSars When they figured that @GbemiFizzy was not going to backdown, they started appealing.

#EndSARS"
OmoGbajaBiamila,"@gbemifizzy @PoliceNG @EndSars As you can hear from the audio in the video, the police officers could not say exactly what the young men in the Camry did wrong.
